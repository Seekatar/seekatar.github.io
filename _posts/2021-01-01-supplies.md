## Hardware

### [Silhouette Cameo Cutting Machine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VLB3627/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07VLB3627&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=99314274bc7e1c674116a9abe3c70360) <small>(paid link)</small>

I love this cutting machine. According to Amazon, I purchased it on May 7, 2014, and have used it for many projects over the years. I use it for cutting vinyl, paper, cardstock, and even heavy Bristol paper. The software is pretty easy to use, and if you watch for sales, you can upgrade to the higher levels pretty cheaply. The latest version even has a "pop-up" feature that helps you make parallel folds out of a shape you create.

## Software

### [Strathmore 300 Bristol](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00254AU8Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00254AU8Q&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=2de8cdb5419da0d38ea1bed26302a574) <small>(paid link)</small>

Nice, heavy paper for the base of cards. You can get smooth, or slightly textured versions. Pay attention the the grain when you cut for your card. You want to have the main folder perpendicular to the grain.

### [PrismaColor Colored Pencils](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IGMJ6R6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01IGMJ6R6&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=7608ff8f1a6021f33431e88319009133)

I used these often for coloring smaller items. They are wax-based and you'll want to get a blending pencil to achieve smooth effects.
