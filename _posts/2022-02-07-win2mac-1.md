## A .NET Developer Moves to the Mac

This is part one of a series of posts about my journey as a developer moving from a Microsoft OS to macOS. To give you an idea of how long I've been with OSes from Redmond, I was really excited when I could upgrade MS-DOS to support double-sided 5&frac14;" disks. Since then I've been on OS/2 (IBM + MS venture) Windows 3.1 and finally to Windows 10.

I am all about using the command line and keyboard shortcuts for doing everything. This series will focus on my efforts to become a productive .NET developer on a Macbook Pro (M1 processor) running macOS Monterey. There are other very useful blogs out there (see [links below](#links)), but I haven't found one that really helps to migrate from a keyboard-loving Windows developer to using the Mac.

## The OS

The macOS is like Unix so the folder structure will look like you're on Linux. This isn't a Unix lesson, but a brief list of things you know how to do on Windows, but where is it on the Mac. In future posts, I'll cover the terminal and dev tools.

## Menus

There is only one menu and it's _always_ on the upper left of the current monitor, regardless of where the app's window is on the screen. As you change apps, the menu changes to that app's menu.

## Keyboard and Mouse

The keyboard is similar enough to be familiar, yet foreign. This will take some getting used to.

| Screen to clipboard                      | Win+PrintScreen        | Ctrl+Shift+⌘+3                          |

| Screen capture & record menu             |                        | Shift+⌘+5                               |

Once an image is on the clipboard run Preview.app and do ⌘+N (File->New from clipboard)

You can't use the keyboard in a `Message Box` by default. Change this by System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts then check “Use keyboard navigation…”

In Windows, you can click a button or menu on any window. On the Mac, you can only click on something in a window if it has focus. For example, you're in a Slack video call and check your email. You need to talk so you click the mic to unmute, but that only sets focus back to the window. Click again to unmute.

## File Open Dialog

Like Finder mentioned below this is hard to use if you're used to using file paths. The column view will make it a bit more Windows-friendly, but you can't just put in a path like `~/myfile.txt` You can use the hotkeys mentioned below, but ⌘+Shift+G opens a dialog that allows you to paste in a path.

## Where is that Windows feature on the Mac?

### Clipboard history (Win+V)

You can install a third-party utility. I used [FlyCut](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12) and so far it's ok. I set Ctrl+⌘+Z as its hotkey.

### Control Panel (Win+I and Control Panel)

System Preferences app in the Dock (TaskBar) has the most functionality. Search for the option you want. Monitors are under Displays.

### Event Viewer, Device Manager

Hold Alt and press the Apple icon in the upper left then click `System Information...` to get a read-only view of system settings.

* Hardware has device Info
* Network
* Software
  * Frameworks
  * Installation to show the history of installs
* Logs

For more logging check out Finder, then `Shift+⌘+U` Utilities then `Console`

### Explorer (Win+E)

Finder (⌘+Alt+Space) gets you close. If you're used to accessing paths, you'll be frustrated. There are some hotkeys to get to some folders, and Column view makes it a bit more of what you're used to, but try going "up" to a parent folder.

* Shift+⌘+C Computer
* Shift+⌘+D Desktop
* Shift+⌘+H Home folder
* Alt+⌘+L Downloads
* Shift+⌘+N New folder
* Shift+⌘+O Documents
* Shift+⌘+U Utilities (see below)
* Move folders to Favorites by dragging (not shown in context menu)
* Shift+⌘+. to show hidden files

### Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)

Finder, then Shift+⌘+U Utilities then Activity Monitor

## Next Time

In this blog, I've tried to give you a step up to quickly become familiar with using the macOS, if you've come from a Windows environment. I hope I've covered the main areas. There is more to MacOS and keyboard than I've covered in Part 1.

In Part 2, I'll show how I customized the terminal and installed PowerShell.
