This is the last in a series of blog posts about creating a set of Azure DevOps YAML pipelines to standardize across many projects.

> [!NOTE]
> In this series I walk through the build and deploy process from the beginning, but I do assume you are familiar with the basic application lifecycle concepts.

1. Typical Kubernetes Build and Deploy Azure DevOps Pipelines
1. Moving Azure DevOps Pipelines Logic to a Template Repository
1. Creating a Dynamic Azure DevOps Pipeline
1. Azure DevOps Pipeline Tips, Tricks, Gotchas, and Headaches

## Tips

1. Always manually run a new or updated pipeline off a branch since you will be running it many times to get it to work
1. Use `Validate` in the kebab menu on the web to catch many types of errors before doing a `Run`
1. After a pipeline runs, you can use the kebab menu `Download logs` to download a zip file of all the logs and the `​​azure-pipelines-expanded.yml` file which shows the yaml after all templates have been expanded.
1. To re-run a failed pipeline when some environment change should have fixed it (no code or yaml change), you can `Rerun failed jobs` to rerun the same code.
1. To re-run a pipeline with new code and the same parameters as before, click `Run New` from the pipeline to avoid re-entering any custom parameters.
1. To get more verbose logging when manually running a pipeline, check the `Enable system diagnostics` checkbox. You can also add this task to dump a file listing and env vars at any point in a pipeline: `- template: /templates/dump-environment.yml@loyal-templates`

## Tricks

### Add DryRun Option

Add a `dryRun` parameter to your pipeline defaulting to `false`. Then when manually running it, you can set it to `true` to see what would happen without actually doing it.

- For builds, this should build and run unit tests, but not push the artifact.
- For K8s deploys, this should dump the K8s manifests to the logs so you can review them to make sure the values are what you expect. In particular, look for `$(` which indicates that a name inside the parens isn’t set, e.g. `$(UnSetName)`

### Run a Step Only on Failure, or Always

condition

### Watching for $(...) Output

When I deploy to K8s use Helm, I usually dump out the manifests in a dry run. You can validate what will be deployed before you deploy it. When looking this output there should be no `$(myVar)` variables. If there are, that means that the variable `myVar` is not set in the pipeline and will be sent to K8s as-is, which will cause an error.

You can use this technique for any text that is generated in the pipeline.

### Using DevOps Variables in Scripts

If you have a bash or PowerShell script in your pipeline and want to use variables or parameters, you have to be careful since they are replaced verbatim. Both of these will work fine in most cases, but what if `MyVar` or `MyParam` contains a `$` or `"`? Then you will get a syntax error at runtime. Passwords can wreak havoc.

```yaml
- pwsh: |
    Write-Host "MyVar is $(MyVar)"
    Write-Host "MyParam is ${{ parameters.MyParam }}"
  name: Echo it dangerously
```

It's usually best to pass in values as environment variables like this:

```yaml
- pwsh: |
    Write-Host "MyVar is $env:MyVar"
    Write-Host "MyParam is $env:MyParam"
  name: Echo it safely
  env:
    MyVar: $(MyVar)
    MyParam: ${{ parameters.MyParam }}
```

### Dumping Out Files and Environment Variables

### Getting the Expanded YAML of a Pipeline Run

### Manually Running a Pipeline with the Same Settings

### Adding Multiple YAML Pipelines at Once

## Troubleshooting

### My Parameter Value Isn't Used

Spelling counts, but misspelling is ignored. For example, if you a task take a parameter `myParam` and you pass in `myParm` is will not warn you about `myParm`. If `myParam` is required it will bark about that one missing.

### My Pipeline Isn't in the List of Pipelines

The default Pipelines view is the `Recent` tab. If you've never run it yet, it will be in the `All` tab.

### My Build Pipeline Isn't Getting Triggered

Check your `triggers:` section in the `build.yml` It restricts which branches and files will trigger a new build.

Edit the pipeline in the browser, and click on `Validate` from the kebab menu to see if there are any syntax errors in the YAML, which would prevent the pipeline from running.

### My Deploy Pipeline Isn't Getting Triggered

The deploy should only be triggered by a successful run of the build pipeline. Check the `resources.pipeline` section of the `deploy.yml` to make sure it is configured correctly. The `source` must be the exact name of the build pipeline in Azure DevOps. The `resources.pipeline.trigger` should only trigger on the `master` branch.

Edit the pipeline in the browser, and click on `Validate` from the kebab menu to see if there are any syntax errors in the YAML, which would prevent the pipeline from running.

### Helm `already exists` error

If you get an error like this that says the resource already exists, it could be a couple issues.

```text
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with install: CronJob "featuretoggles-effective-date-job" in namespace "default" exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error: key "meta.helm.sh/release-name" must equal "my-cool-job": current value is "my-kewl-job"
```

1. The resource already exists in the cluster, but was not created by helm.
2. The resource was created by helm, but the `meta.helm.sh/release-name` annotation was changed. This could be because the new helm configuration has a different name. You will see this if you split a values.yaml file that did multiple things into separate files, where each one has a different `releaseName`. A new cron job build and deploy split out of an API build and deploy will get this.
