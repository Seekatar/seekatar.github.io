## Developing .NET Apps

This is part three of a series of posts about my journey as a .NET developer moving from a Microsoft OS to macOS. In [part 1](/2022/02/07/win2mac-1.html) I covered the basic differences between macOS and Windows, and [part 2](/_site/2022/02/12/win2mac-2.html) covered command lines. In this, probably final, issue I'll cover my experiences after a month of doing .NET development on the Mac.

My company provides [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) as the commercial IDE, and I also have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I was a Visual Studio power user before and jump to both the mac and Rider was quite a jump. One month in and I'm still struggling to be productive in Rider. This is mainly to do with the keyboard.

## Writing Code

I like VSCode since it really handles multiple types of files well. I can jump from C# to PowerShell, to Bash, to Docker, to Helm quickly and easily all within the same IDE.
