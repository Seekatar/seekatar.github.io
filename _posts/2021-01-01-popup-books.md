### [Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784945145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1784945145&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=124c503e7069b8abb89f7574ae2f00d5)

by Duncan Birmingham

For me this is _the_ book on pop-up engineering. It covers almost every pop-up mechanism I've seen in a well-organized fashion. Perhaps a bit too technical for some, I enjoy his comments on the theory behind the mechanism, and how adjusting one angle affects another.

In this blog I will refer to the mechanism with the numbers in this book. For example, Foundation Shape 7, would be FS7 (parallelogram).

This is his revised version of his earlier book, [Pop Up!: A Manual of Paper Mechanisms](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1899618090/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1899618090&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=dbc26ae8a6386432f5d8bfa97a1b56b1), which I also recommend if you can find it.

As an aspiring paper engineer, I created every one of the nearly 100 popups of his first book.
