### [Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784945145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1784945145&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=124c503e7069b8abb89f7574ae2f00d5) (paid link)

For me this is _the_ book on pop-up engineering and I can not recommend it enough. It covers almost every pop-up mechanism I've seen in a well-organized fashion, with clear, color photographs and plenty of examples. Perhaps a bit too technical for some, I enjoy his comments on the theory behind the mechanism, and how adjusting one angle affects another. This is his revised version of his earlier book below.

In this blog I will refer to the mechanism with the numbers in this book. For example, Foundation Shape 7, would be FS7 (parallelogram).

by Duncan Birmingham

This is the first Birmingham book, which I also recommend if you can find it. Smaller, and with black-and-white illustrations, it has 120 different mechanism, some with several variations.

As an aspiring paper engineer, I created every one of the popups of this book on 5 1/2 x 4 1/4 (quarter of a sheet of letter) paper.

A great book for learning the various techniques about popups. The first section covers one-piece techniques using one sheet of paper and cutting it. Then multi-piece techniques with gluing on other pieces. Finally a section full of examples of designing popups with directions for building them, as well as many examples of professional popups.

This is a one of series of books about folding paper.

No longer in print, this one is interesting in that it is itself a popup book with examples of many mechanisms. Each little popup has a paragraph explaining it with the popup itself annotated with notes about angles and dimensions. Other mechanisms such as pull tabs and wheels are also covered.  In addition to the working samples and directions, you can get the diagrams for all the mechanisms from David Carters [site](http://www.popupbooks.com/surprise.html)

by Trish Phillips, Ann Montanaro

As the title suggest, this has 50 well-thought out projects of varying difficulty. It also has a great section about the history or popups.
