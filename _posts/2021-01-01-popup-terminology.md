## Popup Mechanisms

This table briefly describes the basic popup mechanisms used for about every popup you'll see. BH2 refers to the number in [Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784945145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1784945145&linkCode=as2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=124c503e7069b8abb89f7574ae2f00d5), one of my favorite books.

Name|BH2|Description
-|-|-
Right-angle V Fold|FS1|Basic of mechanisms that stands vertically and usually opens away from the viewer.
Acute-angle V Fold|FS2|Most common an versatile of mechanisms that form a V shape opening away or towards the viewer.
Pointed V Fold|FS3|Similar to FS2, but very pointed.
Acute-angle V Fold|FS4|A V fold with obtuse angle.
Asymmetric V Fold|FS5|A V with different angles. These make popups a bit more interesting.
Parallel Fold|FS6|A mechanism with a fold parallel to the main fold to form a triangular shape when opened 180 degrees.
Parallelogram|FS7|Mechanism has folds parallel to the main fold and when opened 90 degrees forms a rectangle.
Asymmetric-Parallel Fold|FS8|Similar to FS6 and FS7, only the sides are the the same length.
Zigzag Fold|FS9|Similar to FS1 with additional folds.
M Fold|FS10|A V fold with more V folds, this gives you many planes and folds to build upon.
Floating Plane|FS11|A plan that is parallel to the base when opened 180 degrees.
Box|FS12|An enclosed box with sides parallel to the main fold.
Open-topped Box|FS13|Similar to FS12, with no lid. Like FS12, it may be circular
Pyramids|FS14|As the name suggest, a pyramid and variations of it.
Curved Shapes|FS15|Derived from a V or parallel fold, the mechanism pops up with curved sides.
Twisting Mechanism|FS16|An interesting mechanism that twists as the page is opened. It also gives you many options for building more mechanisms on it.
Automatic Pull-strip|FS17|As the page is opened a strip pulls up a half cylinder or parallel shape.
Moving Arms|FS18|Always a favorite since the movement can be dramatic as an arm moves when the page is opened.
