## Pop-Up Terms

180-degree card
: A card the opens flat (See [Thankgiving Turkey](/2021/10/30/thanksgiving-turkey.html))

90-degree card
: A card the opens only to 90-degrees. (See [Mars Rover](/2021/03/28/mars-rover.html))

Zero-degree card
: A card where the design is created by layers of paper that can be opened one at a time. No 3D mechanism is involved. (2021 Christmas card coming in December)

## Pop-up Mechanisms

This table briefly describes the basic pop-up mechanisms used for about every pop-up you'll see. BH2 refers to the number in [Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture](/2021/01/01/pop-up-books.html#pop-up-design-and-paper-mechanics:-how-to-make-folding-paper-sculpture), one of my favorite books.

### Foundation Shapes

| Name                     | BH2  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Right-angle V Fold       | FS1  | Basic of mechanisms that stands vertically and usually opens away from the viewer.                                             |
| Acute-angle V Fold       | FS2  | Most common an versatile of mechanisms that form a V shape opening away or towards the viewer.                                 |
| Pointed V Fold           | FS3  | Similar to FS2, but very pointed.                                                                                              |
| Obtuse-angle V Fold      | FS4  | A V fold with obtuse angle.                                                                                                    |
| Asymmetric V Fold        | FS5  | A V with different angles. These make popups a bit more interesting.                                                           |
| Parallel Fold            | FS6  | A mechanism with a fold parallel to the main fold to form a triangular shape when opened 180 degrees.                          |
| Parallelogram            | FS7  | Mechanism has folds parallel to the main fold and when opened 90 degrees forms a rectangle.                                    |
| Asymmetric-Parallel Fold | FS8  | Similar to FS6 and FS7, only the sides are the the same length.                                                                |
| Zigzag Fold              | FS9  | Similar to FS1 with additional folds.                                                                                          |
| M Fold                   | FS10 | A V fold with more V folds, this gives you many planes and folds to build upon.                                                |
| Floating Plane           | FS11 | A plan that is parallel to the base when opened 180 degrees.                                                                   |
| Box                      | FS12 | An enclosed box with sides parallel to the main fold.                                                                          |
| Open-topped Box          | FS13 | Similar to FS12, with no lid. Like FS12, it may be circular                                                                    |
| Pyramids                 | FS14 | As the name suggest, a pyramid and variations of it.                                                                           |
| Curved Shapes            | FS15 | Derived from a V or parallel fold, the mechanism pops up with curved sides.                                                    |
| Twisting Mechanism       | FS16 | An interesting mechanism that twists as the page is opened. It also gives you many options for building more mechanisms on it. |
| Automatic Pull-strip     | FS17 | As the page is opened a strip pulls up a half cylinder or parallel shape.                                                      |
| Moving Arms              | FS18 | Always a favorite since the movement can be dramatic as an arm moves when the page is opened.                                  |
