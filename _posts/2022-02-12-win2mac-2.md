## A .NET Developer Moves to the Mac

This is part two of a series of posts about my journey as a developer moving from a Microsoft OS to macOS. In [part 1](/2022/02/07/win2mac-1.html) I covered basic differences for using the macOs versus Windows. In this episode, I'll cover setting up the terminal to be more like the Windows terminal.

## PowerShell on macOS

Moving to `zsh` is quite a leap. I have tons of muscle memory and scripts in PowerShell that can run anywhere (like my ForEach-Git), so why not use them. If you're a Python or Perl person you'd install those on the mac, so no need to fear the shell. Directions for installing it are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2), but it can easily be install with brew.

`brew install --cask powershell`

The defaults for PowerShell on the mac are geared towards a Unix-like environment, so it will feel different, but you can configure it and iTerm to make it warm and fuzzy for you.

I installed the usual PowerShell modules such as PoshGit, OhMyPosh, etc. with `Install-Module`. Then I copied by [$Profile]() file from my PC that setup PoshGit, OhMyPosh, set aliases, etc. and it pretty much worked. There were a few things I had to check to see if I was on the mac (`if ($IsWindows) {...}`) as you can see in the file. Here are some things that are different.

* n for notepad
* e for explorer
* bc for BeyondCompare
* code for VSCode
* `Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete`
* `Set-PSReadLineOption -BellStyle None -EditMode Windows`

One installed you can run `pwsh` from a terminal and you're good to go. However, you may want `iTerm2`.

## iTerm2

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a great terminal for macOS. It's pretty close to the [Microsoft Terminal app](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). Like Terminal, it allows you to create profile for various shells, or ssh connections. It also supports keyboard mapping and profiles to arrange multiple prompts.

## Next Time

In this blog, I covered how to get PowerShell and iTerm running on a macOS for folks that are coming from Windows. I'm a couple weeks into my mac journey, and found this eased my migration.
