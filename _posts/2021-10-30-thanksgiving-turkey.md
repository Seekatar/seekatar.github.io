November 2021 card. A pop-up for Thanksgiving.

## Idea

When you can't think of an idea for November, a turkey will always work.

## Design

This is a 180-degree card that a couple different mechanisms. For the "feathers", I used three obtuse-angle V folds (FS4), each separated by 5mm. To get the feather spacing consistent and accurate consistent, I used the the computer to draw one, and then scaled it down for the other two. The obtuse angle is 190-degrees since I wanted it pretty vertical.

For the turkey's body, I used the curved-shape (FS15) technique cut by hand. This is a somewhat ovate shape with the top half glued along the edge, and the base glued in parallel from the main fold to give it a rounded shape as it opens up. Then the rest of the turkey is a few pieces folded once and glued together.

The turkey must be forward on the card to keep the feathers from poking out of the top, which gives an empty space on the top. I should have printed on the pre-printed background paper first, but didn't, so I used vinyl letters applied afterwards.

For the cover, I used pastels sprinkled on through a kitchen strainer, then smudge around with my fingers. The pumpkins are some of my son's elementary school artwork (I'm sure he's glad we kept all that!).

## Build

* 9" x 6.5"
* As mentioned above, I used the [Sihouette Cameo](/2021/01/01/supplies.html#silhouette-cameo-cutting-machine) for the feathers.
* The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/2021/01/01/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb, with pastel backgrounds and cut logo on the cover.
* The feather are texture cardstock with a white core. I'm not usually fold of this since one side had parallel line in the texture giving it a tendency to warp, but it does well for this mechanism.
* The rest of the turkey is colored cardstock and paper.
