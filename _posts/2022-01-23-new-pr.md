## Problem

Typing, typing, typing -- and clicking. Azure DevOps sometimes requires lots of typing and mousing around to get some things done.[^1] Creating PRs can be tedious when done manually in Azure DevOps. This is especially painful when you're doing a mass change to twenty microservice repos. Using the [VSTeam](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VSTeam) and [PoshGit](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/posh-git) PowerShell Modules, I can automate creating PRs that can be ready for review! Depending on your configuration, you still may have some clicking to do, but much less.

> **DO NOT** Google VSteam. There are NSFW hits for things I never knew existed.

## Solution

Both of the aforementioned modules are great modules that you should have it you are using git and/or your are using Azure DevOps. I leverage VSTeam in many helper scripts for automating Azure DevOps, but my favorite one is `New-PR`.

```powershell
# absolute minimal call
New-PR
```

This will create a new PR from the current branch to another (defaulting to `main`), set the title to the last commit message, create a new PR, and launch the browser for the PR's page in AzDO.

If you have default approvers set up, that will be already filled in, and you may have to pick an associated work item if that is required. And you can even click `AutoComplete` if your process allows it.

You will have to set up VSTeam credentials with a Personal Access Token from AzDO. I set this in my `$Profile`. To get a PAT click on `User Settings` in AzDO then `Personal Access Tokens`. I created one with `Code (read and write); Package (read)`.

```powershell
# do this once, or in your $Profile
Set-VSTeamAccount -Account $MyAzDoAccountName -PersonalAccessToken $MyAzDoPAT
```

`New-PR` takes the following parameters. If you use the same project often, you can set `$env:AzDoProject` to avoid passing it in. (or use [`$PSDefaultParameterValues`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_parameters_default_values)).

| Name            | Description                      | Default Value       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Title           | PR Title                         | Last commit message |
| Description     | PR Description                   | Title               |
| ToBranch        | Branch to merge current one into | main                |
| AzDoProject     | Project to use                   | $env:AzDoProject    |
| SuppressBrowser | Set to _not_ launch the browser  | False               |

By combining this with [ForEach-Git](https://seekatar.github.io/2021/10/02/foreach-git.html) helper, which I blogged about earlier, you can quickly create a bunch of PRs.

```powershell
ForEach-Git -ShowFolder { git commit -am 'some cool change' && git push && New-PR -AzDoProject $MyProjectName }
```

Now you can create hundreds of PRs with one simple command. Your teammates are gonna luv this.

[^1]: That's why I love Yaml pipelines for deploy since I can automate changes to them.
