## Idea

Covid has been a recurring theme, and this was the third so far. One of the symptoms is the loss of the sense of smell.

And behind the scenes, you learn what the smell test is all about.

## Design

This is a fairly simple design with a very slight acute V (FS2) main mechanism with a parallelogram (FS7) for the bathtub and then a spiral for the tube. Spirals take a bit of trial-and-error to get them working nicely.

## Build

* 9" x 6.5"
* Everything was cut by hand
* The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/2021/01/01/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb, with pastel backgrounds and [PrismaColor]((/2021/01/01/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) colored pencils for illustrations.
* The mechanism is cardstock
