## Another Blog about Raspberry Pi and Kubernetes?!

This is yet another blog about someone installing Kubernetes (K8s) on Raspberry Pis. Most of the blogs I found are focused on the IT side and deploying existing images. As a developer, I wanted to create a cluster to build and deploy my own .NET apps on the Pi. I've included some [links](#links) below to some of the other blogs.

> All of the scripts and code for this are available in this [GitHub repo]( https://github.com/Seekatar/dotnet-webapi.git)

If you're only interested in trying K8s and Helm locally, you can do all that with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), [Podman](https://podman.io/), or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

## Creating the Cluster

You can install full K8s or Ranchers K3s, which is a lightweight flavor of K8s. I chose to install K3s and it went pretty smoothly following [Rancher's quick start page](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/)

To test out K8s, I wanted at least two nodes to test scaling, and tests pulling images onto multiple nodes from a local Docker Registry.

### Hardware

I first started out trying to deploy to the following Pis I had lying around (it's very hard to get new ones now).

* Raspberry Pi 2B for the control plane and worker ðŸ˜„
* Raspberry Pi B for a worker ðŸ˜¢
* Raspberry Pi ZeroW for a worker ðŸ˜¢

The deployment went well, but when running on the B and Zero I got an `illegal instruction` error. Googling, I found that the 2B is the minimum Pi hardware for K8s, so I had to switch to plan B. I had a couple of 3Bs in use, and a 4B that I was saving for other projects, but since it's so easy to switch SD cards, I decided to use the 4B and 2B.

* Raspberry Pi 4B for the control plane and worker ðŸ˜„
* Raspberry Pi 2B for a worker ðŸ˜„

### Raspberry Pi OS Setup

This is the common setup for all the K3s nodes.

I used the relatively new Raspberry Pi Imager tool from the Raspberry Pi [site](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). I chose the `Raspberry Pi OS Lite(32-bit)`, the Bullseye port of 2022-01-18. One of the nice things about the Imager is that you can do much of the configuration when building the image instead of manually on boot. I set the following in its Advanced Options (the gear on the lower right)

![rpi-imager](/assets/images/rpi-imager.png)

* Set hostname
* Enable SSH and set the public key
* Set username and password
* Configure wifi
* Set locale settings

After booting up, the only other thing I did was to set a static IP per the [Raspberry Pi directions](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=205276), which says to edit `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`. The file will have several examples commented out. For my environment, I uncommented out the `eth0` block and updated the values to look like this.

```text
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.200/24
#static ip6_address=fd51:42f8:caae:d92e::ff/64
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8
```

K3s also needs a configuration tweak. Edit `/boot/cmdline.txt` and add `cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory` to the end of the first line. (If you don't K3s will tell you to do it when it fails to start.) Mine looks like this now:

```text
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=a48fb9ae-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
```

### Installing K3s on the Server

[Rancher's quick start](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/) makes it pretty easy by having a script you can download and run to install K3s.

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

For the agents, you need to get the server's token which is in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`

For connecting to the cluster with `kubectl` or tools like [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) from another machine, grab the config from `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`. I copied t to `~/.kube/k3s-config` on Windows. After copying it, edit it to change the `server` value from `localhost` as shown in the snippet below

```text
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: ...
    server: https://k3s-server:6443 <<< change to server name from 127.0.0.1
  name: default
...
```

### Installing K3s on a Worker

Again, [Rancher's quick start](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/) makes it pretty to do for the workers, too.

```bash
export K3S_TOKEN="<token from server's /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token>"
export K3S_SERVER="https://<server's static ip>:6443"
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=$K3S_SERVER K3S_TOKEN=$K3S_TOKEN sh -
```

### Verifying the Install

At this point, the cluster should be up and running. You can run some `kubectl` commands to verify it. You can run these on the server, or on an machine with `kubectl` using the config pulled from the server (and the `server` value edited).

```bash
kubectl version
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

On each node, you can view the logs for K3s with this command if you are having issues.

```bash
journalctl -u k3s # view logs
```

You can also check the K3s configuration

```bash
k3s check-config
```

### Deploying NGINX

## Installing Docker

## Installing Docker Registry

## ASP.NET in the Cluster

It's one thing to pull a Docker image from the hub and deploy it to the K8s cluster, but I want to build and deploy my own images to the cluster.

### Creating the App

For the test app, I simply used the .NET 6 web-api template. There are only a few changes I had to make to `Program.cs` to help it work better with my cluster.

Since I'm going to run multiple apps in my cluster, I will create an ingress (see [below](#ingress)) with a non-root path of `/web-api`. These two lines set the base path of the app to `/web-api`. (For .NET 5 you can use `BasePath` in `appsettings.json` but that doesn't work for .NET 6)

```csharp
app.UsePathBase("/web-api");
app.UseRouting();
```

To show Swagger for a release build and avoid dealing with TLS (I'm going to assume it is terminated before we get to K8s), comment out these lines.

```csharp
//if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
...
// app.UseHttpsRedirection();
```

And finally, since K8s I'll configure K8s health checks in helm, I'll add those endpoints.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", () => "dotnet-webapi. Check /web-api/health/live and /web-api/health/ready" );
app.MapGet("/health/ready", () => "ready" );
app.MapGet("/health/live", () => "live" );
```
