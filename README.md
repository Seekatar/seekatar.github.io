### Running Jekyll

bundle install

# restricts Ruby to use gems in Gemfile
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

### Running Jekyll on the Mac

The Mac has Ruby pre-installed, but is for use by the OS. Use `brew install ruby` and update the path to point to the brew-installed version, e.g. `$env:PATH='/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby@3.1/bin:'+$env:PATH`
