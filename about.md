# About Me

A hands-on software architect well past his sell-by date, I am still learning, still making bugs, and still fixing bugs.

This is where I tell you how cool I am, and my great depth of experience and wisdom that makes yours seem pitiful, but, alas, that is not the case.

Since 2013 I have been making popup cards, and am still aspiring to become a paper engineer.
